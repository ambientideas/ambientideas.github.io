<p>Every once in a while, I post about productivity apps. This time, I've got two that you should go and purchase, now. If you don't you are simply wasting valuable time.</p><br /><p>The first is <a href="http://www.tow.com/msgfiler/" target="_blank">MsgFiler</a>. I've been using it every since I switch to Mac. With a CMD-9 keystroke, it lets you move messages into folders anywhere in your mail folders hierarchy. And trust me, I have a huge hierarchy. I received and sent a little over 28,000 retainable (doesn't count junk or ones I threw out) messages this year. So I need a tool like this, desperately. And Adam Tow, the developer, even takes the time to email back to his users; a rarity these days. <a href="http://www.tow.com/2007/12/27/msgfiler-20-released/" target="_blank">He just rewrote the app for Leopard in Cocoa</a>, and it is amazingly fast (perhaps 5x its previous speed).</p><br /><p>The second product is a GTD implementation called <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/" target="_blank">OmniFocus</a>. It is a task manager on steroids for those of us trying to live the GTD way of life. Couldn't live without it now. I'm hooked.</p><br /><br />
