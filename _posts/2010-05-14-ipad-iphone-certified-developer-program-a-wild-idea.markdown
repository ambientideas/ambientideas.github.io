excerpt: ' As much as we (the Software Engineering industry) detest  testing and certification
  ,  Ben Ellingson  and I were wondering if it would be useful to have an  Apple iPhone
  skills-certified developer program .    The idea would be that a developer would
  pass a certain skills test and then be permitted to directly publish bug-fix updates
  to the store without the  usual review waiting period .  '

  content: I really doubt that this would even be considered by Apple as a possibility.  Just
    like Google Voice could be an email client on version 1.0 and a Skype phone on
    1.1, the fact that Apple doesn't control every aspect of the approval process
    would just scare them from approving anything that even stands a chance of breaking
    the control they already have.

<p>As much as we (the Software Engineering industry) detest <a href="http://www.secc.org.eg/" target="_blank">testing and certification</a>, <a href="http://benellingson.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ben Ellingson</a> and I were wondering if it would be useful to have an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/iphone/" target="_blank">Apple iPhone skills-certified developer program</a>.  The idea would be that a developer would pass a certain skills test and then be permitted to directly publish bug-fix updates to the store without the <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/134698/2008/07/app_store_developers.html" target="_blank">usual review waiting period</a>.  I realize this is controversial and further cements Apple's importance in a software release process where many think they should not be involved.</p>
