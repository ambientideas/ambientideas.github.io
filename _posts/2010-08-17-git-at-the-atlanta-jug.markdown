<p>Today, I'm excited to be presenting Git (my current favorite topic) to the <a href="http://www.ajug.org/confluence/display/AJUG/Home" target="_blank">Atlanta JUG (AJUG)</a> on behalf of the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff Symposium Series</a>.  <a href="http://www.hillert.com/hillert/" target="_blank">Gunnar Hillert</a> has been most welcoming, and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/prpatel" target="_blank">Pratik Patel</a> has been a great promoter of the talk. Thank you both.</p>

<p>In about 75 minutes, I'll explain why the <a href="http://git-scm.org/" target="_blank">Git Version Control System</a> deserves your attention as your next version control system. I'll show you its blazing speed adding 5000 files to a repo, creating a repository at <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, initiating a local branch, merging with a colleague's repository, and finding which commit broke the integration tests.</p>

<p>I've also set up a few resources for attendees to peruse after the talk, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/matthewmccullough/git-workshop" target="_blank">Git Instructions executed during the lecture/workshop</a></li>
<li><a href="http://delicious.com/matthew.mccullough/git" target="_blank">Git Delicious Bookmarks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/training/video/git_101" target="_blank">Git 101 Video</a></li>
<li><a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-git" target="_blank">Matthew's Git DZone RefCard</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In short, if you have the least bit of dissatisfaction with your <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">existing version control system</a>, this talk should tip you squarely in favor of the new world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Version_Control_System" target="_blank">Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)</a>, and specifically, my favorite implementation, <a href="http://www.gitcasts.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>.</p>
