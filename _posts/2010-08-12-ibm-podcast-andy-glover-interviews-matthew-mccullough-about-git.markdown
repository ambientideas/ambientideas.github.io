<p><a href="http://thediscoblog.com/" target="_blank">Andy Glover</a> recently interviewed me for his new series of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ibm-developerworks-podcasts/id153607292" target="_blank">IBM podcasts</a>. I was able to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/scott/entry/glover_and_mccullough_talk_git?lang=en" target="_blank">share about 20 minutes</a> of my <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-gloverpodcast/" target="_blank">experience with and passion for the Git version control system</a> with his audience. It was an exciting opportunity. Thanks Andy!</p>
