<p>As an owner of two "<em>MacBook Pro (late 2008)</em>" units (gotta love the Apple official model title), I've experienced an overheating issue quite frequently. It's becoming known as "hot laptop in bag, syndrome, v2". Here's a quick tour of the problem with a bunch of the news articles published in just the last few days.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5104487/new-macbooks-are-cranky-they-have-insomnia-and-hate-third+party-ram" target="_blank">quick description of the problem by Gizmodo</a> then, the <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1760972" target="_blank">actual thread on the Apple site</a>, followed by a suggestion to use <a href="http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html" target="_blank">SmartSleep to turn on Hibernate mode</a> only, or <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1411" target="_blank">reset your SMC</a>, or <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379" target="_blank">reset your PRAM</a>, or <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/12/10/apple-issues-smc-and-firmware-update-for-all-macbooks/" target="_blank">actually get a firmware fix</a>. Take your pick.</p>
<p>And if you don't find that enough, go ahead and check out the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/921/1049921/inquirer-confirms-apple-macbook-pros-have-nvidia-bad-bump-material" target="_blank">electron microscope pictures and spectrograph of the bump composition that says NVidia</a> is not being transparent about the failing video chip problem.</p>
<p>Does this just make you want to run out and buy one of these new units?</p>
<p>Lest you think I'm switching back to PCs, these Macs are still way better than my last Dell D600 that required 4 complete overhauls for failed components in a 90 day period.</p>
