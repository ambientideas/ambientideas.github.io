<p>I'm a keyboard lover. The productivity from keyboard shortcuts is just amazing. So I'm constantly keeping an eye out for new keyboard navigation techniques. Web browsers have been a sore point, because to click a link with the keyboard you first have to tab to it. This can be, on link heavy pages, 20 or more tabs before I can hit enter. Hardly productive if you ask me.</p>
<p>That's where <a href="http://www.mouseless.de/index.php?/component/option,com_frontpage/Itemid,1/" target="_blank">Mouseless Browsing for Firefox</a> comes in. It puts a number next to each link and you just type the number on the keyboard, press enter, and away you go. It couldn't be easier. Go forth and use the mouse no more for your web browsing efforts and watch your productivity take a leap!<br /></p>
