<p>I am pleased to have been selected to deliver <a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a> and <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a> presentations at three exciting venues in Europe in 2011.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/JFokus-2011.png" alt="JFokus 2011" title="JFokus 2011" border="0" width="122" height="57" style="float:right;" />The exciting sharing of <a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a> begins with <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/">JFokus in Stockholm</a>, Sweden on the 14th of February, 2011. I'll be delivering a <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/speakers.jsp">1 hour Git Intro talk, a 3 hour Git University Session</a>, and a <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/page.jsp?id=training">2 day Git Workshop</a>. It will be my first journey to Stockholm and I'm expecting to see it in its wintery white state. This trip will be made possibly in part by <a href="http://scottchacon.com/">Scott Chacon</a> and other <a href="http://github.com">generous sponsors at GitHub.com</a></p>

<p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/SDC-2011.png" alt="SDC 2011.png" title="SDC 2011" border="0" width="128" height="34" style="float:right;" />The fun in Scandinavia continues with the <a href="http://www.delicious.com/matthew.mccullough/cryptography+newsevent">ever-popular and ever-more-necessary</a> Encryption on the JVM talk at the <a href="http://www.scandevconf.se/">Scandinavian Developers Conference</a> in Göteborg, Sweden on April 4th and 5th. It will be preceded by a <a href="http://www.scandevconf.se/2011/open-event/">Git Workshop</a> taught by <a href="http://ambientideas.com">myself</a> and <a href="http://augusttechgroup.com">Tim Berglund of the August Technology Group</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/33rd-Degree-2011.png" alt="33rd Degree 2011.png" title="33rd Degree 2011.png" border="0" width="139" height="41" style="float:right;" />ScanDev will be quickly followed by DWorld's <a href="http://www.dworld.pl/static/33degree/index.html">33rd Degree Java Conference</a> in Kraków, Poland. I'll share some insights with attendees about Hadoop and Git and have a post-conference workshop on <a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/JAX-2011.png" alt="JAX 2011" title="JAX 2011" border="0" width="114" height="44" style="float:right;" />The final Springtime stop will be at <a href="http://jax.de/2011/speaker/">JAX which will be held in Mainz, Germany</a> on May 2nd through 6th. I'll be delivering a Git talk and a Git university session in the countryside west of Frankfurt.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/JavaZone-2011.png" alt="JavaZone 2011.png" title="JavaZone 2011.png" border="0" width="160" height="43" style="float:right;" />And yes, I'm already planning my September, <a href="http://jz10.java.no/">2011 trip to JavaZone in Oslo, Norway</a>. This conference has become a favorite in so many ways. I love to debut and passionately deliver new talks to this conference and the crowd is so receptive to new ideas and the latest technology. The equally great part about this show is its newly minted <a href="http://jz10.java.no/journey.html">JourneyZone -- an after-conference wilderness adventure in the</a> Norwegian mountains. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/javazone2010">The 2010 edition was fantastic</a>. I don't know how any outdoor adventure could top it. But the organizers say they are trying, and I believe them!</p>

<p>What a year 2011 will be. So much fun and so many places to share all the topics I'm most excited about. I can hardly wait for it to get started.</p>
