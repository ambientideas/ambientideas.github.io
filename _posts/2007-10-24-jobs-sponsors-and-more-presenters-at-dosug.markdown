<p>The momentum at the <a href="http://www.denveropensource.org" target="_blank">Denver Open Source Users Group</a> is really growing. We have three new sponsor companies, including <a href="http://www.atlassian.com" target="_blank">Atlassian</a> and <a href="http://www.rht.com" target="_blank">Robert Half Technology</a>. 35 folks showed up at the <a href="http://www.denveropensource.org/94" target="_blank">last meeting</a> and we've got <a href="http://www.denveropensource.org/96" target="_blank">4 more presenters</a> on board for the coming months. We even have new prizes: more books, shirts, and other graciously donated items such as an <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA 7 license</a>.</p><br /><p>The talk about <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/denveropensource/files/2007-10/" target="_blank">Grid Computing</a> and <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/denveropensource/files/2007-10/" target="_blank">Apache Commons Configuration</a> were well received.</p><br /><br />
