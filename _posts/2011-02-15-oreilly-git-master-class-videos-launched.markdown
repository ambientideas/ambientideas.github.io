<h1 id="oreillygitmasterclassvideoslaunched">Five Hours of Complete Git Training via Video</h1>

<p>I have the privilege of announcing that the videos that <a href="http://www.augusttechgroup.com">Tim Berglund</a> and I recorded in a Denver film studio just a brief while ago <a href="http://oreil.ly/ogitvid">are now for sale at the O&#8217;Reilly online store</a>. These 5 hours of <a href="http://oreil.ly/ogitvid">downloadable and streamable Git training videos</a> are similar to the <a href="http://ambientideas.com/training/">in-person</a> and <a href="http://github.com/training/online">online classes</a> that I teach about this exciting distributed version control system. The price point is aggressive &mdash; a mere $49.95 USD &mdash; and they can be watched, increment by increment, at your leisure from the comfort of your couch at home or discomfort of your next plane flight.</p>

<p>These videos aim to give you a ground-up tutorial on the mechanics <strong>and usage</strong> of the <a href="http://git-scm.org">Git distributed version control system</a>. With the recent milestones of 1,500,000 repositories and 500,000 users at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, the premier place to host Git repositories in a collaborative and dare I say, social way, Git is gaining incredible traction with software craftsmen and craftswomen everywhere.</p>

<p>A few fantastic comments have been made about the videos in the few days that they've been on the market. Here's one from a good friend and long-time NFJS attendee, Darin Pope:</p>
