<p>Last Wednesday I had the privilege of being invited to speak about JavaFX at the <a href="http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a> in Boulder, CO. It was a great audience with some very interesting questions. Thanks to Ken Kim and his team for a great speaking experience.</p><br /><p>Also, thanks to these folks, the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/programr/java-fx-script-from-takeoff-to-cruising-altitude/" target="_blank">JavaFX Script slides I was presenting</a> got awarded "Slideshow of the Day" on slideshare.net for a second time in just one week. These slides were the most viewed and downloaded of any slides on the site. Very exciting.</p><br /><br />
