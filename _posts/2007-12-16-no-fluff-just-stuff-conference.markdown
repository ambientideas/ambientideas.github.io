<p>Several weeks ago, I attended one of the best conferences on software development ever. It was pure learning, from truly knowledgeable speakers. If you've never been before, attend a <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> conference as soon as you can! Jay Zimmerman has even indicated that he'll be able to send a NFJS speaker to the <a href="http://www.denveropensource.org" target="_blank">Denver Open Source Users Group</a> this coming year. Can't wait!<br /></p><br /><br />
