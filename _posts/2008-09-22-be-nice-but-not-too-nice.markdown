<p><a href="http://cio.com/article/print/450066" target="_blank">An article I picked up about "being too nice"</a> from <a href="http://www.augusttechgroup.com" target="_blank">Tim Berglund</a> that was published on <a href="http://CIO.com" target="_blank">CIO.com</a> hits a very sensitive spot. It indicates that being too nice, when it means compromising your position and ideas, is a career risk. When you step back and think about it, that makes perfect sense. I have taken a cautious few steps towards the solidarity-of-position, even when it poses small endangerments of conflict. I am already starting to see some of the benefits. But this is truly a fine line to walk. <a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/features/article.php/12297_3771746_2" target="_blank">Don't take it too far.</a></p>
