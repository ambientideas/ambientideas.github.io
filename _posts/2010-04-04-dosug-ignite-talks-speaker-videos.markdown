<p>The <a href="http://denveropensource.org">Denver Open Source Users Group</a> held an <a href="http://ignite.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Ignite night</a> in February.  We are thankful for <a href="http://virtual-genius.com/">Paul Rayner's</a> volunteering to run the video camera.  I've just begun stitching the videos together with the animated slides, which turns out to be no easy task.  Thank goodness for <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm">ScreenFlow</a>.  I can't imagine how hard it would be to assemble a composite video and align the timing <i>without</i> this amazing product.  Tom O'Brien, Paul Rayner and Tim Berglund are all now onboard with this amazing and award winning piece of software.</p>

<p>The result of the first stitch of my <a href="http://PresentationPatterns.com">PresentationPatterns.com</a> talk, entitled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIHx6py72E">"Information Alchemy for Better Presentations" can now be seen on YouTube in HD</a>.</p>
