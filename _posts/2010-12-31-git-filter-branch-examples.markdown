<p>Have you ever looked at the powerful <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-filter-branch.html"><code>git filter-branch</code> command</a>? It offers, amongst many features, the ability to maintain history while re-writing the tree to a subset of its past self.  A common use case is to prune out a large and unnecessary folder of binaries that was never intended to be under version control.</p>

<p>The <code>filter-branch</code> command can be very confusing at first. What's needed is a set of working examples.  I've got 5 scripted flows to show you how to use it.  Just hop over to my ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/matthewmccullough/git-workshop">git workbook that I use for workshops</a> and look for <a href="https://github.com/matthewmccullough/git-workshop/raw/master/workbook/pdfs/27-Filter-Branch.pdf">module #27 as PDF</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matthewmccullough/git-workshop/raw/master/workbook/htmls/27-Filter-Branch.html">as HTML</a>. There's a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/matthewmccullough/git-workshop/tree/master/workbook/example-repos/filter-branch">set of samples</a> in the example-repos directory.</p>

<p>If you are interested in more of these type of advanced moves with Git, stay tuned for my upcoming <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnnywey/statuses/13254839601463296">O'Reilly Git Master Class videos</a> (directly O'Reilly link soon), <a href="https://github.com/training/online">monthly Git trainings via GitHub.com</a>, <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/speaker/matthew_mccullough">No Fluff Just Stuff tour stops</a>, or one of my <a href="http://ambientideas.com/blog/index.php/2010/12/matthews-2011-europe-conferences/">international conferences hosting my Git talks</a>.</p>
