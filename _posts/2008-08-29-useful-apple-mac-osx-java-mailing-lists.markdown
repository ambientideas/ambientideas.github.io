<p>The official <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/java-dev/2008/" target="_blank">Apple Mac OSX Java Mailing List Archives</a> contain some excellent technical insights, with replies directly back from Apple in many cases. There's even one great particular article in question that explains <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/java-dev/2008/Aug/msg00181.html" target="_blank">what in the world the A folder is in your /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM directory.</a></p>
