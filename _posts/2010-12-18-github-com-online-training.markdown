<p>I've recently had the privilege of being selected as the <a href="http://github.com/training/online">primary online</a> and <a href="http://github.com/training">secondary in-person trainer</a> for <a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a> on all things Git. We held our first online training on December 14th and it was a smashing success. It was rapidly followed by a private online session for a large US game-producing powerhouse which was an equal success. The second training prompted some fun feedback such as <em>"You are an excellent teacher and the Git course was great."</em> and <em>"I thought I knew a lot about Git until I took your course and realized there was so much more to explore!"</em></p>

<p>With such positive feedback, we'll be running the <a href="http://github.com/training/online">GitHub online Git classes</a> every month now. The next ones are <a href="http://github.com/training/online">January 18th and February 11th</a>.  There will be an updated outline to include <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html">git-svn</a> and a discounted January one-time sale for just $195. Don't miss this opportunity to get bootstrapped with this cutting edge version control system. Git just reached a milestone with over <a href="http://twitter.com/github/status/14982715048730624">500,000 active users and 1,500,000 repositories</a> at GitHub.com. Find out why developers are <a href="http://concise-software.blogspot.com/2009/08/git-scales-enough-for-enterprise-java.html">so excited about this tool</a> and how it can make a <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/05/13/common-git-workflows/">radical difference in your workflow</a> no matter what programming language you use.</p>
