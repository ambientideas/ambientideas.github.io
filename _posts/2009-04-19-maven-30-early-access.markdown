excerpt: "Jason van Zyl hosted a  Maven Meetup at their offices in Mountain View  in
  March of this year.    Lots of deep information about Maven 2.0 and 3.0 was shared
  , and videos of some of the sessions are now starting to be posted to the Vimeo
  web site. \n\n...Here are the takeaway points, highly distilled to 140 proof, for
  those without time to watch the video:   Improved overarching performance (tools,
  engine, resolution, downloads, builds)  Better tooling integration  Tie-ins with
  OSGi  Excellence in Eclipse integration  Possibility of non-XML POMs  Lifecycle
  extension points  High-performance artifact resolution engine  Documentation-hyperlinked
  error messages   If you want to get access to the Maven 3.0 code, you can  view
  the list of SVN checkout URLs here  ( or here for the hardcore Git lovers ), or
  \ just view the source in your browser here . "
