<p>In my consultant capacity, I am helping engineer several applications. One is a Desktop App that has been a Java Swing based application for about 4 years. On version 3.0, it was recommended to switch to a Web Based Application, and a proposal to reuse 80% of the infrastructure was put forward. But instead, the client chose to revamp the Swing app. I think this is an unwise choice, especially for the nature of this CRM application.</p><br /><p>The deployment and distribution costs of desktop apps are quickly becoming an unnecessary cost. Dietrich Kappe makes a <a href="http://blogs.pathf.com/agileajax/2007/10/the-desktop-app.html">similar point here</a>.</p><br /><p>His list of reasons for choosing a desktop app over a web app are brief, and only three points in length:</p><br /><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">1. It is unwise to expose the application to the outside world. Example: power plant management software.</p><br /><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">2. The application calls for integration with custom hardware or mobile devices. Example: scientific software that integrates with custom measurement devices.</p><br /><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">3. The application requires fine control of the underlying video/audio hardware. Example: first-person shooters.</p><br /><br />
