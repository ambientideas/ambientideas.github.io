<p><a href="http://learnjavafx.typepad.com/weblog/2008/02/great-javafx-pr.html" target="_blank">Jim Weaver gave an excellent talk on JavaFX Script last night at the Boulder Java Users Group</a>. He had deep code examples and showcased his NFJS-style winner-wheel example. Always a hit with the audience. His blog has entries about it can be found <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/excellent-javafx-script-presen" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://learnjavafx.typepad.com/weblog/2008/02/great-javafx-pr.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I did a little intro talk prior to that on JavaFX Script as well. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/programr/java-fx-script-from-takeoff-to-cruising-altitude" target="_blank">My slides can be found at slideshare.net</a> along with some of our other past DOSUG presentations as well (just search for DOSUG in the search box).</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
