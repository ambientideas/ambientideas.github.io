I never thought I would see the day when a famous software developer lived on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete">the same island of Crete, Greece</a> that I grew up on.  It is remote, and still had a 1950s switchboard telephone control system when I was there in the late 1980s.  But then again, to each his own.  This is <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Interviews/community/kabutz_qa.html">an excellent article from Java Champion, Heinz Kabutz on becoming a better programmer</a> through a few (albeit rather basic) suggestions.
