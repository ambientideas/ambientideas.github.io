<p>We're hearing rumors that there might not ever be <a href="http://wolfpaulus.com/journal/java/java6osx.html" target="_blank">Java 6 on Mac</a>. Say it isn't so!</p>UPDATE: Well folks, it isn't looking good. <a href="http://www.cafeaulait.org/#October_25_2007_33323" target="_blank">Leopard is Java 5</a> and the Java 6 preview has been ripped down from the Mac Developer site. What gives Steve? Some of your biggest fans are Java coders. If you can't get a final Java 6 to them soon we'll be the laughing stock and will have to resort back to any platform that does delivery Java 6.<br /><br />
