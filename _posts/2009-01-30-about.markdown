I'm actively involved as an Open Source Software Architect for Java and Web Application projects across North, South, and Latin America.  I'm also acting as an Open Source evangelist, speaking about its benefits and practical applications in as many venues as I can.  Currently, my speaking engagements have included the <a href="http://www.denveropensource.org" target="_blank">Denver Open Source Users Group</a>, <a href="http://denverjug.org" target="_blank">Denver Java Users Group</a>, <a href="http://boulderjug.org" target="_blank">Boulder Java Users Group</a>, <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/speaker/matthew_mccullough.html" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff tour</a>, <a href="http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/csopensource/" target="_blank">Colorado Springs Open Source Users Group</a>, and many large corporations.  I'm also authoring a <a href="http://presentationpatterns.com">book on Presentation Patterns with Neal Ford and Nate Schutta</a> due out in 2010.
