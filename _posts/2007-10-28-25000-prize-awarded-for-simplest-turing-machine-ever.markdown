<p>Math, as related to Computer Science is highly intriguing to me. <a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/10/the_prize_is_won_the_simplest.html" target="_blank">This article especially caught my eye</a>, since I saw the <a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/05/today_we_put_a_prize_on_a_smal.html" target="_blank">challenge posted some five months ago</a>. Well, in an untypically fast timeframe for math solutions, Alex Smith from Birmingham, UK has proved that this machine is indeed universal -- the simplest (first?) 2,3 Turing Machine ever proven to be so.</p><br /><p>Just two states and three colors. It is almost a puzzle in and of itself that such a simple machine can be universal. This is a nice rebuttal to the academics that state most innovative solutions in mathematics have already been done by our predecessors. Alex Smith has quite negated that statement through his proof.</p><br /><br />
