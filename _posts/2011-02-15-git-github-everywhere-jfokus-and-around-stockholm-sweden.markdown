<p><a href="http://se.linkedin.com/in/mattiask">Mattias Karlsson</a>, the ever-professional helmsman for the <a href="http://jfokus.se">JFokus conference</a>, had an at-length discussion with me about Git and his conference at the grand <a href="http://devoxx.com">Devoxx show</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp">Antwerp, Belgium</a> this past November. We arrived at a plan to bring <a href="http://progit.org">Git</a>, the innovative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a> from <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/217">Linus Torvalds</a>, in full force to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm">Stockholm, Sweden</a>, home of my great-great grandfather, through workshops and lectures.</p>

<p>It sounded like a good plan, and I received the generous support of <a href="http://github.com/training/online">GitHub, the awesome web-enabled half</a> of Git to make the trip possible. Wanting to maximize the <a href="http://oreil.ly/ogitvid">Git teaching</a> time spent in Stockholm, Mattias and some of my Swedish colleagues helped organize 1, then 3, and now 5 Git <a href="http://www.informator.se/utbildningar/seminarier/seminarier/git-i-ett-notskal.aspx">training opportunities</a>. The plan is now to spend nearly 5 to 10 hours per day teaching Git; I couldn&#8217;t be more excited!</p>

<p>If you are in the Stockholm region and want to learn why Git is <strong>not</strong> just another tool in your belt, but literally a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nanderoo/status/35446250438393856">refreshing new way to think about source control</a> and <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920017462/">code collaboration</a>, then contact <a href="mailto:mattias.g.karlsson@gmail.com">Mattias</a> <a href="mailto:matthewm@ambientideas.com">or I</a>. Get in on one of the events from Monday through Friday of this week (February 14 through 18) and <em>Git Going</em>.</p>

<p>See you in Stockholm!</p>
