It is aptly named <a href="https://bespin.mozilla.com/" target="_blank">Bespin, because it runs entirely in the cloud</a>. Skeptics beware, this has the potential to blow your mind. <a href="http://vimeo.com/3195079" target="_blank">A quick review of the screencast shows of the power and possibilities</a> that a web based editor is strategically poised to execute. Collaborative editing. Collaborative code review. Plugins. Borrowing someone else's setup of plugins. A developer's mind quickly pants with excitement for this to move from alpha to beta as soon as possible. <a href="http://almaer.com/" target="_blank">Go Dion!</a></p>
