<p><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=7927262&amp;#7927262" target="_blank">Apple has a discussion forum going on this very card</a>, but I couldn't make heads or tails of which was actually the right solution. So, I present to you here, screenshots and a walkthrough of the setup.</p>
<p>1) Purchase a Verizon Pantech UM175, one of the latest USB wireless cards from Verizon. Should be able to get it for $0 with a 2 year contract.</p>
<p>2) Plug it in. Mac OSX 10.5 Leopard will detect it as a modem</p>
<p>3) Change the settings per the screenshots below<br />
3.a) Vendor: Sierra, Model: CDMA, Dial Mode: Ignore dial tone when dialing<br />
3.b) Telephone Number: #777, Account Name: YOURNUMBER@vzw3g.com, Password: VZW</p>
