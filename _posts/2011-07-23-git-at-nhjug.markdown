<h2>NHJUG</h2>
<p>I had the wonderful opportunity of being sponsored by <a href="http://nofluffjuststuff.com">No Fluff, Just Stuff Symposiums</a> to speak at the <a href="http://www.nejug.org/events/show/129">New Hampshire JUG</a> in Portsmouth on Tuesday. It was a lively crowd of 20 or so persons hosted by the excellent <a href="http://twitter.com/TheSleepyVegan">Ted Pennings</a>, <a href="http://pblog.theothermattm.com/">Matt Merrill</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/nh_jug">NHJUG</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/curryscott">Scott Curry</a>.

We discussed Git, GitHub, IntelliJ, and eGit with regards to their importance to the broad JVM ecosystem. Many insightful questions were asked, such as "is the efficiency of the hard links to unchanged blobs maintained on Windows." The answer was yes, because this is not actually a POSIX <em>hardlink</em> for commits, but rather an implementation <strong>like, but not exactly hardlinks</strong> inside Git <em>tree</em> objects.<p>

<h2>CFMeetup</h2>
<p>On Thursday, I had the equally delightful opportunity to speak to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/">CFMeetup online group</a>, hosted by <a href="http://twitter.com/carehart">Charlie Aerhart</a> and facilitated in part by <a href="http://twitter.com/mikehenke">Mike Henke</a>, and supported by <a href="http://twitter.com/TimCunningham71">Tim Cunningham</a>.  <a href="http://twitter.com/cfmeetup">It</a> had a turnout of 35-45 persons, and has a significant additional viewership for the <a href="http://ow.ly/5KtdS">recorded sessions at Vimeo</a>.</p>
