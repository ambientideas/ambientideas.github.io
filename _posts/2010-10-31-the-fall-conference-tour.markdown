<p>In the last two months I've had the privilege of presenting at and attending six different technology events. They've been so fun and diverse that a quick recap is in order.</p>

<h2>No Fluff Just Stuff Symposium in Atlanta</h2>

<p>This was my first time presenting at an <a href="http://nofluffjuststuff.com">NFJS</a> event in Atlanta, and you can be certain I'll be back. Earlier in the Summer, I had the opportunity to address the <a href="http://ajug.org">Atlanta Java Users Group (AJUG)</a> and show off the flexibility of Git. For the NFJS Symposium, I talked about Hadoop, Git, Encryption on the JVM and Open Source Debugging, which are my "fun but informative talks" lineup for 2010.</p>

<h2>Colorado Springs Open Source User Group</h2>

<p>Gary Hessler runs a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/csopensource/">great user group</a> in Denver's sister city to the south. I had the opportunity to present <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>, one of my favorite topics since it is accessible no matter what language you program in and what platform you use. My NFJS colleague, <a href="http://augusttechgroup.com/">Tim Berglund</a> presented his always well-received <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/minneapolis/2010/10/session?id=19435">Decision Making</a> talk. It is an interesting divergence from the typical programmer presentation and gives you techniques to deal with team dynamics.</p>

<h2>JavaZone in Norway</h2>

<p>The ever-excellent <a href="http://www.java.no/">JavaBin User Group</a> in Norway put on a stellar conference called <a href="http://jz10.java.no/">JavaZone</a> for 2000+ people. What a show! The diversity of talk formats, speakers, and topics is simply incredible. After the conference, about 25 of us experienced a once-in-a-lifetime event of hiking in the Norwegian countryside. The <a href="http://jz10.java.no/images/foredragsholdere.png">otherworldly photos</a> and <a href="http://jz10.java.no/journey.html">hike details</a> will make you want to attend next year!</p>

<p>The sessions are recorded at JavaZone and two of mine are available online. The former was in the big room in a formal setting. The latter talk was in a smaller room at the end of the conference and had a more informal feel where questions could be asked of the audience and vice-versa.
<a href="http://streaming.java.no/tcs/?id=67136867-86E5-4BA8-94AC-8C617A7331DE">Encryption Boot Camp on the JVM</a></p>

<p><a href="http://streaming.java.no/tcs/?id=EC102300-8325-4744-A28B-A83E311AAACD">Hadoop: Divide and Conquer Gigantic Datasets</a></p>

<h2>StrangeLoop in St. Louis Missouri</h2>

<p>After returning from JavaZone, I headed to Missouri for the <a href="http://strangeloop2010.com/">super-technical event named StrangeLoop</a> brewed by <a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/">Alex Miller</a>. The lineup of speakers was stellar and the non-profit atmosphere was very relaxing. <a href="http://www.hilarymason.com/">Hilary Mason</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele,_Jr.">Guy Steele</a>, <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/">Yehuda Katz</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch">Josh Bloch</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Doug Crockford</a>, and many others. I will be attending next year if the timing works out again.</p>

<h2>No Fluff Just Stuff Symposium in Minneapolis</h2>

<p>My home base of conferences, <a href="http://nofluffjuststuff.com">NFJS</a>, brought me up to the always warm audiences of Minneapolis. This has to be one of my top-5 favorite stops on the tour due to the beautiful hotel and the technologically advanced attendees. Their questions are deep and I try to be as prepared as possible for them. I had the privilege of <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/speaker/brian_sletten">Brian Sletten</a> and <a href="http://www.devjam.com/">David Hussman</a> sitting in my classes about <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a>.</p>

<h2>SpringOne</h2>

<p>The sprint of conferences concluded with my attendance and helping out with the logistics of <a href="http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/chicago/2010/10/home">SpringOne2GX</a> in Chicago. The hotel was spectacular and the attendance overwhelming. It seemed to be just shy of a 1000 people and double last year's attendance. I attended some great sessions and had hallway chats with the likes of Hamlet D`Arcy, Hans Dockter, Paul King, Andres Almiray (our co-incidence rate at conferences is getting to be uncanny!), Peter Bell, and Chris Beams. I'll try to put in some abstracts for next year and get invited to speak!</p>
