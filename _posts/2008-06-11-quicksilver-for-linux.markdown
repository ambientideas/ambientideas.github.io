<p>There's a new Linux competitor to <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/" target="_blank">QuickSilver</a> in town. It's called <a href="http://blog.davebsd.com/2008/06/09/gnome-do-05/" target="_blank">GNOME Do, and it just reached version 0.5</a>.</p>
<p>It offers the same quick keyboard shortcut commands that QuickSilver does. Noun-verb-directobject goodness abounds.</p>
<p>If you've never used QuickSilver on the Mac, use it for a week, and you'll never be the same again. The keyboard takes on a whole new power.</p>
