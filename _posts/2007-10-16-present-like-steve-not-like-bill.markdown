Jordan over at <a href="http://www.ambientideasphotography.com">Ambient Ideas Photography</a> sent me a <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/09/steve-bill-redu.html">unique article that contrasts and compares Bill Gates' and Steve Jobs' presentation styles</a>.  One is brief, the other is wordy.  One uses minimalistic slides, the other writes prolifically in slides.  Whom would you rather listen to?
