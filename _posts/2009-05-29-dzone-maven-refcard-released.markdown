excerpt: |
  <p>I'm very pleased to announce that my DZone Maven RefCard was released this week ahead of schedule, and JavaLobby did a little introductory interview for the launch. A handful of folks contributed to the early alpha reviews and I want to acknowledge their inputs: Ken Sipe , Tim O'Brien , Chris Maki , Tim Berglund , and Jason van Zyl . ... I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the Maven community , and this was by far the most fun I've had building materials to promote this unique Convention over Configuration build tool.</p>

A handful of folks contributed to the early alpha reviews and I want to acknowledge their inputs: <a href="http://kensipe.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Ken Sipe</a>, <a href="http://www.discursive.com/" target="_blank">Tim O'Brien</a>, <a href="http://cmaki.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Chris Maki</a>, <a href="http://www.augusttechgroup.com/" target="_blank">Tim Berglund</a>, and <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/people/author/jason/" target="_blank">Jason van Zyl</a>.</p>
<p>The timing was great, as I did a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/matthewmccullough/mastering-maven-20-in-1-hour-v13" target="_blank">Mastering Maven talk</a> at the <a href="http://www.sdjug.com/" target="_blank">San Diego Java Users Group (SDJUG)</a> on Tuesday night. A handful of the attendees came with printed copies of the RefCard in hand!</p>
<p>I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">Maven community</a>, and this was by far the most fun I've had building materials to promote this unique Convention over Configuration build tool.</p>
