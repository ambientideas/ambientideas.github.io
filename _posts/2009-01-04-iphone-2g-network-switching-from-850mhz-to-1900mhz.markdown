<p>Here's an interesting, though only lightly cross verified fact. <a href="http://www.ofb.biz/safari/article/512.html" target="_blank">AT&amp;T might be moving the 2G network over to the 1900Mhz band (your phones are practically tri-band, nowadays) and using 850Mhz for more of the 3G network.</a> 850Mhz penetrates barriers more easily, thereby yielding, in most cases, a better signal reach and strength. I have noticed and commented to co-workers (prior to this article) an lessened ability to get 2G signal in many of my normal locations around Denver. So to me, this is a consumer scientific same-data-point test, and I'm seeing reduced throughput and signal strength (in some cases, 0 bars now at places I used to be able to get 2 or 3). Comments from anyone with a 1st Gen iPhone?</p>
