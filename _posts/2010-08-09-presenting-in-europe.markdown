<p>I'm excited to announce that I'm presenting several informative talks in Europe and Scandinavia this Fall.</p>

<p>

First up is <a href="http://javazone.no/incogito10/events/JavaZone%202010/sessions" target="_blank">JavaZone</a> in Oslo, Norway. I can't believe this classy and large of a show is put on by a <a href="http://www.java.no/web/show.do?page=178" target="_blank">user group</a> (in a sports arena). Clearly, it has a great committee and a <a href="http://twitter.com/kristoffer79" target="_blank">great director</a> at the helm. This is where I first met the likes of <a href="http://olabini.com/" target="_blank">Ola Bini of JRuby</a> and <a href="http://kohsuke.org/" target="_blank">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> of Hudson fame.  If you are in reach of Norway, this is a must-see developer event with presenters gathered from all over the world.</p>

Next up is the exciting <a href="http://oredev.org/2010/sessions/better-builds-with-maven-3-0" target="_blank">&Oslash;redev in Malm√∂, Sweden</a>. I've heard from my colleagues at <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> that this is a stellar event. The quality of materials &Oslash;redev has sent out to speakers has been amazing thus far, and literally table-discussion worthy for inclusion in our <a href="http://www.presentationpatterns.com/" target="_blank">Presentation Patterns book</a>. I'm going to be in <a href="http://oredev.org/2010/speakers/evan-doll" target="_blank">every one of Evan Doll's iOS sessions</a>.</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Devoxx-Logo.jpg" width="300" height="112" alt="Devoxx Logo.jpeg" /><br/>
Finally, I'm presenting a nitro-enhanced version of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/matthewmccullough/jvm-encryption-boot-camp-043" target="_blank">Encryption on the JVM</a> at <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/Devoxx2K10" target="_blank">Devoxx in Antwerpen, Belgium</a>. Another conference (<a href="http://jazoon.com/" target="_blank">like the awesome Jazoon</a>) in a movieplex? Anytime! No worrying about the size of code samples on the screen, that's for sure. Is a 30 meter screen big enough for you? I hear that Devoxx is the JavaOne of Europe. The <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/Devoxx2K10/Conference" target="_blank">lineup of speakers is phenomenal</a>. I will be in a chair for every session besides mine.</p>

If you are in Europe, or are of a <a href="http://www.tripit.com/people/matthewmccullough" target="_blank">traveling persuasion like I am</a>, any one of these three venues would be a big enhancement to your knowledge and relevancy in the JVM development world in 2011. I hope to meet many of you I've only spoken with digitally before. I've already received dozens of <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewmccull" target="_blank">"see you there messages."</a> Add your name to that list.</p>
