<p>I was asked about Open Source Billing solutions via email today. It had been a while since I had reviewed this space, but a few minutes in my deli.cio.us network revealed some interesting titles:</p><br /><ul><br />  <li><a href="http://www.sisd.com/freeside/" target="_blank">Freeside billing and trouble ticketing</a> (primarily geared towards ISPs)</li><br /><br />  <li><a href="http://www.citrusdb.org/" target="_blank">CitrusDB</a> (CRM, Customer Care, and Billing for ISPs, Consulting and Telcos)</li><br /><br />  <li><a href="http://www.jbilling.com/" target="_blank">JBilling</a> (I'm pleased to see that one is based on the JEE platform)</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Al, Scott, I hope you find these products beneficial. Let us know which one you settle with and I'll post your review here.</p><br /><br />
