<p>I had the pleasure of presenting seven talks at the <a href="http://nofluffjuststuff.com" target="_blank">NFJS Reston Virginia</a> show this weekend.  Two of those talks were Git-centric.  One was a traditional presentation and the other was a workshop. In the latter, I was asked about my custom Git-status shell prompts.  <a href="http://ambientideas.com/blog/index.php/2010/08/git-bash-prompt/" target="_blank">Earlier in my blog, I've pointed to my Mac, Linux, and CygWin BASH prompt scripts</a>, but I'd also like to point to my ZShell based scripts as well, which are now <a href="https://github.com/matthewmccullough/Git-ZShell-Prompt" target="_blank">housed in their own GitHub repository</a>. Fork, commit, and send pull requests!</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone that attended and made it a great time for me through their interactivity and questions.</p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-263"></a>I had the pleasure of presenting seven talks at the NFJS Reston Virginia show this weekend.
