<p>Well, it looks like Swing continues to be a technology that has matured enough to be left out to pasture. In addition to the Swing team departures at Sun, the most recent related event is that <a href="http://forums.java.net/jive/thread.jspa?messageID=313969" target="_blank">SwingX, one of my favorite libraries, has stopped being funded</a>. I don't see this as a huge problem, as most applications are heading to the web nowadays unless they have a hugely compelling reason to be on the desktop (Development IDEs, CAD, Drawing, Graphics apps). JavaFX continues to be the also-ran in the RIA lineup against <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/" target="_blank">Flex</a> (forefront) and <a href="http://silverlight.net/" target="_blank">Silverlight</a> (2nd place).</p>
