I've just discovered the <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock web browser</a>, based on Firefox.&nbsp; It is like taken to the next level.&nbsp; If you use Blogging tools, and Social Bookmarks, you must check out this browser!&nbsp; It offers convenience-tools (built-in) for all kinds of Social Web activities.
