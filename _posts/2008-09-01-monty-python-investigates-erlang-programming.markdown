<p>Got this link from my Twitter network, and haven't laughed this hard in weeks. If the crew of Monty Python all got together and decided to do a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5830318882717959520" target="_blank">show about the programming language Erlang, this is what it would look like</a>. 80's haircuts (70's?), DTS telephone systems, and prolific use of Sun Workstations with X Windows in 16 colors (or is it monochrome?). <a href="http://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank">Erlang has a bit more modern web site now</a>, but the video image will forever be emblazoned in my mind.</p>
