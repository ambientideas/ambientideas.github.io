A concept we&#39;ve tried to share with clients with mixed success is  <br>&quot;minimalism&quot;.  Too much content or too much activity on a web page  <br>merely disturbs the user, and doesn&#39;t necessarily satisfy their  <br>craving for information.  The Apple iPod is the chief example of this  <br>that everyone can relate to.  They eventually did away with the  <br>buttons, leaving just one central &quot;jog wheel&quot; to control a very  <br>powerful device.  Sales climbed.  The device was lauded as a  <br>breakthrough.  This pattern can be applied to all kinds of web  <br>interfaces as well, but the willingness of of clients to let us do  <br>that is still not quite there.<p><a href="http://rainfall-daffinson.com/minimalism/">http://rainfall-daffinson.com/minimalism/</a>
