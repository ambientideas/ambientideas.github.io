<p>When running an <a href="http://www.denveropensource.org" target="_blank">Open Source Group</a> such as the <a href="http://www.denveropensource.org" target="_blank">Denver Open Source Users Group</a> or attending another <a href="http://denverjug.org" target="_blank">technical Users Group</a>, I find folks engaged 50% and falling asleep wanting the presenter to just finish up the other 50% of the time. It is painful to be in audience when wanting such a speaker to wrap up. It is ever worse when occasionally you ARE that speaker they want to wrap up.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time we rehearse so well for the "quick dips" into some technologies that we <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-09/st_pechakucha" target="_blank">could present them in Petcha Kucha format</a>. This is a <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/" target="_blank">type of presentation that lasts exactly 400 seconds with each slide on screen for exactly 20 seconds</a>. It requires impressive rehearsal and great density of information. Code demos could come as an after-session roundtable or just be downloaded at home by the audience, as they wouldn't really fit into such a format.<br />

<p>What do you think? Leave a comment. Your input will be fashioned into <a href="http://www.denveropensource.org/upcoming" target="_blank">DOSUG's future meetings</a>.</p>
