<p>I can hardly believe <a href="http://www.details-worktools.com/product_details.php?pid=740" target="_blank">this work/exercise unit is truly in production</a>, but sure enough, it is...</p><br /><p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3137/2561422647_a5ca6fcceb.jpg" width="420" height="480" alt="A7TG660606H.jpg" /></p><br /><p>And although I can hear you runners out there getting excited, you will be dismayed that it maxes out at 2.0MPH. They are trying to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/miqCAUVZBbI" target="_blank">hip marketers with this YouTube video</a>, but somehow, I just can't see any of my coworkers crying out for this, nor getting an employer to pay for it.</p><br /><br />
