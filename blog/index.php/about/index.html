	I&#8217;m actively involved as an Open Source Software Architect for Java and Web Application projects across North, South, and Latin America.  I&#8217;m also acting as an Open Source evangelist, speaking about its benefits and practical applications in as many venues as I can.  Currently, my speaking engagements have included the <a href="http://www.denveropensource.org" target="_blank">Denver Open Source Users Group</a>, <a href="http://denverjug.org" target="_blank">Denver Java Users Group</a>, <a href="http://boulderjug.org" target="_blank">Boulder Java Users Group</a>, <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/speaker/matthew_mccullough.html" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff tour</a>, <a href="http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/csopensource/" target="_blank">Colorado Springs Open Source Users Group</a>, and many large corporations.  I&#8217;m also authoring a <a href="http://presentationpatterns.com">book on Presentation Patterns with Neal Ford and Nate Schutta</a> due out in 2010.
