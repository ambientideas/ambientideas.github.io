== Description ==

SyntaxHighlighter Evolved allows you to easily post syntax-highlighted code to your site without loosing it's formatting or making any manual changes. It uses the [SyntaxHighlighter JavaScript package by Alex Gorbatchev](http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter) and a bit of code by [Andrew Ozz of Automattic](http://wordpress.com/).

**SyntaxHighlighter "Evolved"? Why Evolved?**

Starting with v2.0.0, this plugin was renamed from "SyntaxHighlighter" to "SyntaxHighlighter Evolved". This was done to better stand out against the many very poorly named [forks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29) of v1.x of this plugin. I am not an author of any of those plugins, they just used my old code as a base for their version. Although I am of course biased, I'd argue this plugin is the best of all of them.

You do not need to escape HTML entities or anything, just post your code as-is. The plugin will handle the rest.

The shortcodes accept a wide variety of parameters. For details, see the bottom of the plugin's settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The code boxes seem to be missing their styling. What's wrong? =

Make sure your theme's `header.php` file has `<?php wp_head(); ?>` somewhere inside of the `<head>`, otherwise the CSS files won't be loaded.

= The code is just being displayed raw. It isn't being converted into a code box or anything. What's wrong?  =

Make sure your theme's `footer.php` file has `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` somewhere inside of it, otherwise the Javascript files won't be loaded.

**Version 2.1.0**

* Updated to reflect the new features of [v2.0.320 of Alex's script](http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter:Changes:2.0.320). Note the `stripBrs` parameter is not supported in my plugin as it is not needed in this implementation.

* Added a link to the settings page to the plugins page in the admin area

**Version 2.0.0**
